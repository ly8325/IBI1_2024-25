For week 3:
I got the feedback that you only have one commit message and it does not provide any information about what files were added or updated.
I commit the practical 3 again to fix it.

For week 4:
I got the feedback that your code generates a truth table but it is not copied in the comments.
I wrote a new comment to present a truth table.
I got the feedback that the answer is mostly correct, but it was numbers between 1 and 6 not 1 and 5.
I changed the code I wrote.

For week 5:
I got the feedback that it does not display the dictionary, and when the data in the dictionary changes it will not change on the plot.
I change the line5 and 6 to two codes: language = list(popularity.keys())
users = list(popularity.values()) to extract data from the dictionary.
